### Product Paparazzi

### User Story
As a business owner who does not have a storefront, I would like a website that can help me verify that my products are on the shelves at the retailers who stock my products. When I, as the business owner, log into the site I should see a full list of images that display my products, the name of the product, the name of the retailer and the date it was uploaded. To incentivise my customers to use the site, and continue purchasing my products, there should be clear incentives on the site. I would like my users to have the option to increase their rewards by subscribing for a small fee.
As a user of the site, I would like to recieve discounts on the products I already purchased. I would like a secured login to the site. When I log into the site, I should be able to see the photos I have uploaded of the products. I should be able to edit or delete the uploaded information if I made a mistake. I would like to see my incentives level, and be able to redeem my points for coupon rewards. I would like the option to subscribe so I can get extra benefits.
